							</p>
							<p>
							Drive in and pick a table(s). First come first serve. We do not take
							reservations. You may park behind the table(s) and leave your vehicle there for
							the day for loading and unloading purposes. There are a few tables with names
							painted on the top, do not set up there, as these are paid for and reserved for
							the season. Although a few tables are reserved, you will not have trouble
							finding a spot.

							<p>
							The Flea Market Manager will come around the market to each table in the
							morning to collect the table fee(s) and provide you with a receipt.
							</p>

							<p>
							Tables without a roof are $10 per day, per table of ours you use. You may bring 
							a few small tables to set up alongside of our table for no extra cost. Keep in
							mind that half of the empty space between the next built in table will be yours
							to use, and the other half your neighbors.
							</p>

							<p>
							Tables in the open air sheltered building are also $10 per day, per table of
							ours you use. There are dividers on the top of the tables that mark the line of
							1 table. In this space there is not room to set up additional tables of your
							own.
							</p>

							<p>
							Stand-alone tables with a roof are $13 per day. There is room to set up
							additional tables of your own. Same rules apply as tables without a roof.
							</p>

							<p>
							We do have open space available for vendors who wish to set up without using
							our tables, you will be charged according to the amount of space you use. If
							you are taking up what 1 tables space would be, you will be charged for 1
							table. If you are taking up the space of two tables, you will be charged for
							two, and so on and so forth.

							<p>
							Please contact us if you are interested in renting a building.

							<p>
							Vendors are expected to clean up around their table(s) at the end of the day,
							taking all of their garbage home with them. We work hard to keep our market a
							clean, pleasant environment and appreciate your help maintaining it.
